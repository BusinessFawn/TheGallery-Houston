# TheGallery-Houston

This site was designed for a wedding venue in Houston to support 2 primary features: 
  Allow a shared calendar to be viewed in an aesthetically pleasing way
  Allow for easy submission of email inquiries directly through the site
  
The first goal was achieved by using json data from Google Calendar and presenting it with the help of fullcalendar.js.

Secondly, by sanitizing emails on the front end for user-ease and server side for security we were able streamline
correspondence from perspective customers and eradicate malicious attempts made at the venue owner and staff of the site.

With the two primary goals completed the focus was on a light and appealing feel, site load times, and responsive design throughout the site.
